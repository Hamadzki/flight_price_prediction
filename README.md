# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Model

## 🌟 Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project on predicting flight prices using machine learning techniques. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and model selection and building. Additionally, a web app is developed to predict flight prices based on user-uploaded data.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **🧹 01 Data cleaning.ipynb**: Handles the preprocessing and cleaning of the flight data.
- **📊 02 EDA.ipynb**: Conducts exploratory data analysis to understand the data's structure and features.
- **💻 03 EDA with SQL.ipynb**: Analyzes data using SQL queries for efficient data manipulation.
- **🧠 04 Hypothesis testing.ipynb**: Includes hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about the data.
- **🔧 05 Feature Encoding and selection.ipynb**: Performs feature encoding and selection to optimize model inputs.
- **🤖 06 Model Selection.ipynb**: Compares various machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing model.
- **🏗️ 07 Model Building.ipynb**: Builds the final model using the selected algorithm for flight price prediction.
- **🧠 model_building_pytorch.ipynb**: An alternative model built using PyTorch for deep learning applications.
- **🚀 flight_price_deploy.ipynb**: Details the deployment process for the web app.

## 🌐 Web App
The web app allows users to upload flight data files and predict prices based on the trained model. It is built using `Flask` and can be run locally or deployed on cloud services.

- **📜 deploy.py**: The main script for deploying the web app.
- **💡 deploy_help.ipynb**: A guide to deploying the app and troubleshooting common issues.

## 📁 Data
